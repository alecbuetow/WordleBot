This repository contains the code needed to access the New York Times daily Wordle puzzle and solve it via greedy search algorithm. 

## Key Takeaways

- **Performance**: Solves the Wordle Puzzle 3.6 guesses on average, compared to [New York Times' best performing model's](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/17/upshot/wordle-wordlebot-new.html#:~:text=Only%20slightly.,more%20times%20in%20hard%20mode.) 3.4.
- **Feature Selection**: Utilizing a Fourier transformation, we extracted the individual component waves of the smoothed EEG reading. We retained the waves with the five greatest amplitudes along with their frequencies. We also binned waves into biologically significant groups by their frequency (e.g. alpha, beta, detla, etc.) and averaged their amplitudes.
- **Random Forest Model**: A Random Forest Model was utilized to differentiate the three stages of sleep, chosen for its resilience to overfitting and ease of interpretation.
